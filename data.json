        "question": "Are lightsabers allowed inside the convention?",
        "answer": "We'd love to see your lightsaber skills, but for safety reasons (and to prevent any accidental dismemberments), lightsabers are a no-go. You can still channel your inner Jedi through cosplay, though!"

        "question": "What's the deal with cosplay weapons?",
        "answer": "Good question! We're totally cool with cosplay weapons, as long as they're peace-bonded by our friendly Wookiee security team. Just remember, no Death Star lasers, please."

        "question": "Do I have to speak Klingon to attend the Sci-Fi panel?",
        "answer": "Nah, you're good! While speaking Klingon would earn you some nerd street cred, it's not a requirement. Our panelists are fluent in English, Wookiee, and a few other intergalactic languages."

        "question": "Can I bring my pet Tribble to the convention?",
        "answer": "As cute as Tribbles are, they have a tendency to multiply faster than you can say 'Beam me up.' To avoid a furry catastrophe, please leave your Tribbles at home."

        "question": "Can I use the Bat-Signal to find my friends?",
        "answer": "While it's tempting to summon your pals with the Bat-Signal, we recommend sticking to good old-fashioned text messages. It's quicker and doesn't attract Gotham's rogues' gallery."

        "answer": "Ah, a true geek classic! The airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow is approximately 24 miles per hour. Just remember, that's in Earth's atmosphere, not Middle-earth."
