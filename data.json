        "question": "Are lightsabers allowed inside the convention?",
        "answer": "We'd love to see your lightsaber skills, but for safety reasons (and to prevent any accidental dismemberments), lightsabers are a no-go. You can still channel your inner Jedi through cosplay, though!"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "question": "What's the deal with cosplay weapons?",
        "answer": "Good question! We're totally cool with cosplay weapons, as long as they're peace-bonded by our friendly Wookiee security team. Just remember, no Death Star lasers, please."
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "question": "Do I have to speak Klingon to attend the Sci-Fi panel?",
        "answer": "Nah, you're good! While speaking Klingon would earn you some nerd street cred, it's not a requirement. Our panelists are fluent in English, Wookiee, and a few other intergalactic languages."

    {
        "id": 4,
        "question": "Will there be snacks?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! We've got snacks fit for hobbits, replicators stocked with sci-fi treats, and butterbeer that would make even the Hogwarts gang jealous. Leave your ration packs at home!"
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "question": "Can I bring my pet Tribble to the convention?",
        "answer": "As cute as Tribbles are, they have a tendency to multiply faster than you can say 'Beam me up.' To avoid a furry catastrophe, please leave your Tribbles at home."
    },
    {
        "id": 6,
        "question": "What happens if I accidentally time-travel during the Doctor Who panel?",
        "answer": "Don't panic! Our Gallifreyan panelists are experts in timey-wimey stuff. They'll have you back in your proper era in no time. Just be sure not to step on any butterflies."

        "id": 7,
        "question": "Do you have a lost and found for misplaced teleporters?",
        "answer": "We sure do! If your teleporter ends up in the wrong galaxy or just vanishes into a parallel universe, swing by our Lost & Found. Our crew of dimension-hoppers will help you out."
    },
    {
        "id": 8,
        "question": "Can I use the Bat-Signal to find my friends?",
        "answer": "While it's tempting to summon your pals with the Bat-Signal, we recommend sticking to good old-fashioned text messages. It's quicker and doesn't attract Gotham's rogues' gallery."
    },
    {
        "id": 9,
        "question": "Is there a costume contest?",
        "answer": "You bet your utility belt there is! Get ready to strut your stuff on our cosplay stage. Prizes include the admiration of fellow nerds and some sweet loot from across the multiverse."

    {
        "id": 10,
        "question": "What's the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?",
        "answer": "Ah, a true geek classic! The airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow is approximately 24 miles per hour. Just remember, that's in Earth's atmosphere, not Middle-earth."
